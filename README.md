# Image manipulation demo project with AssemblyScript

To compile the AssemblyScript file execute

    npm install
    npm run asbuild

Then run a web server locally and open the index.html file.

You should compare the JavaScript code inside index.html and assembly/index.ts to understand the similarities and differences between JavaScript and AssemblyScript.
